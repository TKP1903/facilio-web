                    </b>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    COVID certainly surprised us all! Like many people around
                    the world, I began working from home as a safety
                    precaution—and my kids were also home from school. It’s been
                    a challenging time for us, but humans are agile beings. We
                    adapted our lives to make it work, balancing both work and
                    life at home.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    But it was important for all of us—adults and children
                    alike—to understand a few key aspects of this new reality:
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    First, being present at home does not mean automatic
                    availability for the kids. It’s not a day off like it used
                    to be!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Second, being home does not mean we’re automatically
                    available to work.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Everyone had to learn to create new boundaries between home
                    life and work/school life to stay sane and stay on top of
                    our responsibilities.
                  </p>

                      Absolutely. Zooming in to the professional side—the
                      banking sector is critical and requires error-free and
                      timely operations. The need to provide healthy and safe
                      spaces as well as protecting business continuity was a
                      critical task. Stakes were high and facility managers had
                      to quickly regroup and embrace the change. From your
                      perspective, what were some of the biggest challenges for
                      facility managers to deal with?
                    </b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Banks obviously cannot be bystanders as a crisis like COVID
                    develops—they need to serve as a source of resilience and do
                    what they can to help consumers and businesses weather the
                    storm.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Industry’s first priority and biggest challenge was
                    ensuring a safe environment for both employees and
                    customers. Policies and procedures to limit the spread of
                    the virus were created and also clear communication
                    protocols were established between facilities and employees
                    about these new procedures.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For example, sanitary measures to protect employees and
                    customers in branch locations were reinforced, office spaces
                    were regularly cleaned, hand sanitizers and disinfectant
                    whenever necessary were distributed, the amount of physical
                    space between workers was increased, meetings were done via
                    conference calls, and other remote communication solutions
                    (telephone, video calls, emails, etc.) were encouraged
                    whenever possible.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    These measures helped to keep people safe while also
                    maintaining continuity of services for the customers

                      We’re seeing how firms that already had a digital

                    While digitization in banking was trending before COVID, the
                    pandemic has greatly accelerated this trend. The same goes
                    for digitization in facilities management. The outbreak
                    served as a catalyst for change, highlighting why we need to
                    pay attention to how our facilities are being managed and
                    how services are being delivered.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For example, the pandemic has forced us to view soft
                    services that support our workplace environment through a
                    new lens. There is a growing need for automating FM business
                    processes—everything from move-ins, service requests and
                    maintenance, to energy management or workspace
                    customization.

                  <p>
                    In addition, there is little doubt in my mind that COVID-19
                    will accelerate changes in office design. The most evident
                    is occupational density. Previously on a steep upward trend,
                    occupational density has been thrown sharply into reverse in
                    the midst of social distancing. Once a vaccine or effective
                    treatment is available, we will likely see a movement back
                    toward the pre-COVID densities, but health and well-being
                    will remain top of mind for occupiers. This will likely
                    prevent a return to full pre-COVID levels for some time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also expect that office spaces will be redesigned to
                    enable necessary face-to-face interactions—like meetings and
                    collaboration spaces—repurposing space once dedicated to
                    full-day occupancy desks.

                    Moving forward, facilities managers could be involved in
                    more business-wide decisions to balance the use of office
                    buildings with home workers. Organizations will be
                    challenged to maximize building efficiency with reduced
                    occupancy. FMs are also likely to find themselves rolling
                    out new initiatives to maintain a comfortable and productive
                    remote workforce. We’ll need to achieve all of this while
                    spending is under increased scrutiny, so it will be crucial
                    to optimize budget and finding ways to spread costs.

                    Finally, now that we’re all adapting to a new way of life,
                    my advice is this:

                    Let’s not just go back to work. Let’s all look to move
                    forward.
