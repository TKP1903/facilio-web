They also hold the responsibility to remove a particular user when the user leaves their organization.

                    Name and work email (Specifically tagged as work email)  is collected and stored in a database table called <span class="legal-content-heading-small">Account_Users</span>. This is the only table where the information gets stored, and an ID is generated for the corresponding user in that particular organization. Only the ID is referred to in all other places in the database. This specific table can be encrypted. In this form, only Name is the PII collected and can not be avoided. Usually, the Facility Manager signing up for Facilio's services uses this Page, and he becomes the Super Administrator for the account, for their organization, and has access to all data that is entered in this account.
                    The Facility manager becomes the controller of all data belonging to the organization. Facilio acts as a processor.

This is the only table where the information is stored, and an ID is generated. Only the ID is referred to in all other places. In this form, the Name, email ID, and phone number are collected and can not be avoided. For Labour addition, the work location address is collected.  Email ID and Phone numbers are collected to send a notification to the technician when a work order is assigned to him or if he must manage an asset.  The controller has to make sure that the email ID and phone numbers are official email id/phone numbers. Facilio also performs a regular audit ( once in 3 months ) of the data in the Account_users table. If we identify any personal email IDs ( like @gmail/@yahoo, etc.), we notify the controller to get the consent. However, this kind of validation cannot be performed for phone numbers. Hence, phone number detail is not mandated in these forms. Further, the details entered in the Account_users table are integrated with 3rd party tools (Email Server for sending email notifications)  and (Twilio for sending SMS notifications ). Facilio triggers notifications only on tasks related to Work order management/alarms/asset management and does
                  not send any other notifications to the end-user.
                  Further, all data that is transferred from and to the 3rd party tools are managed to secure TLS lines.

                  When Facilio Visitor Management/Service portal is used for a visitor management system, the Facility Manager and the Tenants in a Facility can use Facilio to invite people, Invite Vendors and record visits of Guests. In all these forms, the Name, phone number, Email ID, and Address of the visitor is collected, which are all classified as PII. This information is stored in the <span class="legal-content-heading-small">"Visitor"</span> table of the database, and this storage is encrypted. Again this email ID and phone numbers are processed for email generation /SMS generation for  Invite/ check-in and check-out of the visitor. All transit data is handled through secured lines. The information that goes into this portal is directly done with the consent of the visitor/vendor, and if there is a need/concern regarding this data,
                  the Facility manager/controller can delete the visit/invite, and the data gets removed from the database immediately.

The Name, phone number, Email ID, and Address of the Vendor - which must most probably be an official address, but it can also be personal information. Again this email ID and phone numbers are processed for email generation/SMS generation for  Invite/ check-in and check-out of the vendor since Vendor management is interconnected to visitor management.

                    The main areas where personal data is held in Facilio is found in Person/Users, Labour/Tenant/Visitor/Vendor. But there are many more places like custom modules where there is a potential to store personal data.  Email ID and Phone numbers are often referenced with User Name as a unique key, that gets referenced as a numeric value generated in one of the above-mentioned tables.

                    Facilio Databases are designed to determine if a person's data is no longer needed / or if a concern arises regarding storing one's data, then the data can be removed with immediate effect without creating referential integrity issues by the controller

                    Through the above two practices that are followed, GDPR compliance and security of personal data is significantly controllable by the controllers/facility managers that use Facilio.
