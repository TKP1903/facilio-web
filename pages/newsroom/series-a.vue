                  Tech start-up offering the world’s first unified IoT and
                  AI-driven facilities optimization software, has announced a
                  funding of USD 6.4 million led by international venture
                  capitalists Tiger Global Management, LLC and existing investor
                  Accel. Tiger Global has several successful early stage
                  investments in companies
                  <div id="pro"></div>including Flipkart, Freshworks, Peloton and Invision. Accel is

                  Founded in 2017 by cloud and IoT veterans Prabhu Ramachandran,
                  Rajavel Subramanian, Yogendra Babu and Krishnamoorthi
                  Rangasamy, Facilio offers real-time facilities management to
                  commercial real estate owners, using IoT and AI to
                  predictively optimise operations and sustainability, while
                  providing a superior tenant experience. Within a year of
                  starting commercial product availability, the company has
                  exhibited strong performance and market penetration across its
                  global territories – Middle East, US, and India. “Buildings
                  today need agility to adapt to a rapidly transforming
                  landscape. Legacy systems, high upfront costs and long
                  implementation cycles of traditional FM software vendors are
                  bogging down clients with their inflexibility. There is a
                  definitive shift towards embracing an IoT and AI led software
                  system that empowers the built environment with speed and
                  agility to improve efficiencies. We aim to be frontrunners in
                  leading this transformative change in the industry”, said
                  Prabhu Ramachandran, Founder & CEO, Facilio Inc.

                  “Bringing data-driven efficiencies to building operations and
                  enabling a superior occupant experience is the future of
                  commercial real estate, and Facilio is well positioned to lead
                  this transformation. The company's passion and vision to
                  tackle a universal problem with significant impact and growth
                  potential is highly compelling,” said Lee Fixel, partner,
                  Tiger Global. “On a global basis, facilities management
                  services and energy spend by buildings each account for more
                  than a trillion dollars. I am optimistic that Facilio can be a
                  true disruptor in this industry”.
