                  Facilio, the Atlanta-based FM-Tech start-up with operations in

                  digital transformation. “Complex, rigid & siloed FM-tech

                  The Middle East is currently in the process of redefining its
                  role in the world and is undergoing massive transformation.
                  There is a strong emphasis on the adoption of
                  technology-driven innovation and next-generation
                  infrastructure, among several of the region’s governments. The
                  business community is no less driven in its pursuit of
                  diversification with ambitious expansion plans. “From the
                  Smart City, Sustainability & Digital Retrofit goals of Dubai
                  to the rapid urban planning and development across Saudi
                  Arabia, commercial real estate is booming. And with the
                  growing size of built environments and building portfolios,
                  the need to manage them more efficiently is only becoming
                  greater. Facilio can add to this transformation by enabling
                  the transition to the next generation of tech-enabled, modern
                  facilities, that are led by real-time data, are predictive,
                  and balance the management of assets, workforce, and energy.
                  So we feel we are in the right place at the right time, and
                  for us, the Expo is a great platform to showcase this to the
                  entire region”, adds Prabhu.

                  There is a widespread consensus that optimal performance
                  efficiencies require targeted technology solutions created for
                  the specific needs of the FM industry. “Repurposed industrial
                  applications are limited in their impact and the commercial
                  real estate industry has realized our platform represents a
                  quantum leap over legacy players. The future belongs to
                  modular solutions that can be integrated in infinite ways,
                  using data-informed cognitive technology”, concludes Prabhu.
