                 Facilio Inc., an AI-driven property operations and maintenance platform, today announced the launch of REbuild, a ready-to-deploy operations toolkit that helps real estate owners respond to the operational challenges posed in the post pandemic recovery phase. REbuild is in line with Facilio’s mission to provide robust tech solutions that helps the industry adopt a flexible and agile operating model. The new operational toolkit enables real estate owners and operators to generate quick wins by remotely controlling building operations, automating maintenance processes, and restoring tenant confidence. REbuild also includes a knowledge-sharing video series, a community resource that can be streamed on-demand, featuring practical insights, case studies, and best practises from industry peers, globally.

The REbuild toolkit was developed from Facilio’s experience in working with clients and industry experts. The result is the launch of a flexible set of solutions that helps the owners adapt to a constantly changing reality and operate efficiently.”.

                 Prabhu believes REbuild will evolve further in response to the industry’s needs as more new issues will need to be resolved creatively over the next 24 months - as a fallout from COVID-19. “We started Facilio to bring technology driven efficiencies to the real estate industry that hadn’t adopted cloud, mobility, or predictive analytics in a meaningful way. The global pandemic situation will accelerate digital transformation, allowing owners to automate more of their portfolio operations and make informed, data-driven decisions. We’re looking forward to the continued partnership with automation OEMs and system integrators to quickly roll out solutions that helps the industry navigate new conditions with agility.”
