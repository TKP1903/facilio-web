                    Quadrant IoT Platforms For Smart Buildings 2019’ and

                    evaluations of industry trends and players, and their
                    assessment of Facilio’s vision and execution has been very
                    positive.
                  </div>

                  <div class="legal-content-para">
                    Both reports have identified Facilio as a fast maturing
                    start-up redefining the value addition that the FM function
                    delivers, and effectively challenging the industry status
                    quo and incumbents due to the innovation and modern
                    intuitiveness of its product. The only independent
                    benchmarking of software vendors with IoT based products in
                    this space; the ‘Verdantix Green Quadrant IoT Platforms For
                    Smart Buildings 2019’ report was created on the basis of
                    live product demonstrations and a comprehensive 108-point
                    questionnaire, which surveyed 304 real estate customers.
                    Facilio’s addition to the quadrant as a Challenger is
                    particularly noteworthy as it’s the youngest company,
                    positioned against long established industry leaders like
                    JCI, UTC, GE and Siemens. “Facilio is not encumbered by
                    legacy approaches and has built its solution with IoT in
                    mind from the outset” says Dennis Callaghan, Principal
                    Analyst at Verdantix. “Facilio’s centralized IoT platform
                    unifies disparate data, from multi-vendor automation systems
                    and equipment, across a portfolio of buildings, and delivers
                    a suite of cloud-based solutions for operations and
                    maintenance. Being able to deliver machine-learning based
                    predictive and real-time optimization of assets makes a
                    compelling case for a relatively recent entrant to be
                    identified as a clear challenger to the status quo. We found
                    their interface intuitive and simple,

                    with highly customizable dashboards. Customers shouldn’t
                    have much of a learning curve. Facilio was built for the
