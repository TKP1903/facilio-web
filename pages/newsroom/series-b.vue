                 Founded in 2017, Facilio offers a unified software platform that leverages an 
                 AI-led predictive engine to help real estate portfolios digitize processes and 
                 optimize their property operations. Replacing the traditional and siloed software 
                 landscape that has frustrated the market for decades, the solution aggregates data 
                 from multiple, disconnected systems across portfolios into an integrated, 
                 cloud-based platform, helping operations & maintenance [O&M] teams become 
                 data-driven and agile. The platform encompasses a suite of SaaS applications 
                 for maintenance [CMMS/CaFM solutions] and operational visibility, sustainability, 
                 and remote equipment performance monitoring. This modern approach allows customers 
                 to reduce operating costs, exceed sustainability targets, and elevate customer 
                 experiences.
