                  be showcasing their unique native mobile app. The App is
                  designed to further simplify facilities management and
                  building operations by allowing facility teams to work with
                  real-time condition-based analysis of equipment and issues,

                  “The world of facilities management has been changing
                  drastically. And building in everyday operational efficiencies
                  and sustainability is becoming a pressing challenge for FM’s.
                  Our objective has always been to simplify the complex layers
                  of managing facilities and buildings, and provide FM’s and
                  CRE’s with full control and portfolio-wide visibility, at
                  their fingertips. Our IoT and AI-driven Facilities
                  Optimization Suite, which we are showcasing at the event, will
                  demonstrate how our solution unifies people, assets and
                  machines for a seamless facilities experience by deriving
                  insights from existing data. As an example, our predictive
                  fault detection and diagnostics mechanism captures BAS data
                  from existing systems, intelligently correlates fault alarms,
                  triggers automated work orders to desired staff – all in
                  real-time! We really make it that simple”, says Prabhu

                  “The FM market in the Middle East is poised for serious
                  transformation. And technology innovations and automation are

                  they would be using technology & CAFM to grow their business
                  further. The report also cites sustainability & IoT, and their
                  convergence, as the sweet spot FM’s should be aiming for to
                  maximize their gains. Facilio’s solution integrates both these
