                                While QFM saw demand for better-maintained properties and instant service resolution,
                                they were unable to procure real-time operations insights or minimize compliance risks.
                                What QFM needed was a tool that delivered proactive intelligence. But rather than
                                helping streamline routines, conventional CaFM and ERP solutions were rigid and failed
                                to adapt to their conditions and requirements. And it was a matter of time before QFM's
                                reactive maintenance felt the pinch.

                                compliance issues across their expanse of facilities, the operators remained in the
                                dark. And despite an adept workforce and basic digital tools, QFM was pulled back from
                                augmenting its service quality to tenants.

                                Quality Group partnered with Facilio to deliver agile services that put customers’ needs
                                first. QFM started off by automating thousands of maintenance routines to digitize
                                compliance and save staff time.

                                As the next step, QFM rolled out dedicated portals for tenants and vendors. Now, tenant
                                feedback could be channelized to benchmark vendor performance and also to provide
                                on-demand access to property services. By engaging with tenants in real-time, QFM could
                                easily consolidate building-wise service requests. This was tied to granular operational
                                insights that drove better decisions.

                                time. With transparency into such details as average response time and completion rate
                                for every technician, tracking staff productivity was within the reach of QFM managers.
                                And when there were SLA breaches, QFM owned the flexibility to customize escalations so
                                the key stakeholders could be promptly notified to resolve issues. Ultimately, QFM’s
                                KPIs across portfolio improved significantly.

                                agile operations and create immense value for the end-user.
