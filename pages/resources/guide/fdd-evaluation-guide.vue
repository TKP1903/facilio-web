                  Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) tools automate investigation into the abnormal performance of
                  building systems. As a core component of Energy Management and Information Systems (EMIS), these tools
                  simplify energy analysis and make results more accessible.

                  Thanks to impressive potential to realize energy savings up to 30%, FDD has captured early interest in

                  It’s important to keep in mind that a good FDD solution is much beyond just a ‘software’. And how it
                  fits in your business operations impacts what best you can get out of it.

                <p class="legal-content-para">
                  We developed a simple framework to capture key elements that you can use to assess various FDD
                  solutions. The categories in the framework touch upon attributes spanning delivery model, software
                  location, flexibility, operational intelligence, and total cost of ownership

                  Choosing an FDD product versus a service should be decided according to two prime factors— -
                  availability of time, and technical resources. As the system that predicts and alerts you to
                  performance anomalies, you should expect your solution to require <span style="font-family: ProximaNovaBold;">minimal technical expertise.</span> But
                  technical knowledge is often perceived as an obstacle to choosing a product over service, and many
                  people believe that the learning curve on analytics is pretty steep in the former. (Modern FDD
                  frameworks are fast-evolving to overcome efficiency bottlenecks—no big picture, lack of control,
                  specialized skills gap—more on this in a later section).

                <p class="legal-content-para mT30">
                  On the flip side, with an FDD service, you’ll be bound by your service provider and will miss out on
                  ownership of data for precise evaluation of your overall operational performance. A product can give
                  you visibility and freedom to understand property performance in multiple ways.

                 Advanced FDD solutions are opening up opportunities for owners to pursue a streamlined, portfolio-wide application, rather than a cumbersome building-wise deployment. They make it easy to  configure rules across buildings in one go. Owners can avoid  time delays and grappling with system limitations that are commonplace with a building-by-building setup.

                  It is largely understood that there’s immediate value in using data and analytics to identify and
                  address inefficiencies in building operations. But it’s becoming increasingly obvious that while these
                  are useful insights,<span style="font-family: ProximaNovaBold;"> it’s difficult to convert findings to
                    real-time operational changes or actions. </span>

                  You need a strong mechanism that integrates FDD and building operations to Control & Command Automation Systems—in real-time. This integration expands the scope of efficiencies—from energy alone to portfolio control, such as commands based on space scheduling, occupant-driven app-based controls, and so on.

                  Facilio’s Centralized FDD engine proactively detects and diagnoses inefficiencies in building asset
                  and energy performance across a portfolio of buildings. Unlike traditional BMS-dependent FDD systems,
                  Facilio’s cloud-based FDD engine is seamlessly tied to operational workflows and unites all
                  stakeholders (from mobile and on-site teams to command center experts and facility decision-makers).
