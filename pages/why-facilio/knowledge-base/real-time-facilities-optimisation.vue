              <p>
                Real-time facilities optimisation (RTFO) is an approach that
                buildings use to achieve operational efficiency, improve NOI and
                provide best facility experience for tenants by managing
                facilities the smart way. In this approach, using IoT to
                leverage data from existing building automation systems,
                otherwise unused, can empower you with actionable insights, in
                real-time. Instead of relying on piecemeal software for various
                aspects of building management, real-time facilities
                optimisation can help you to centrally manage and

              <h3>Why is it important to optimise facilities in real-time?</h3>
              <p>
                Today, almost everything around us is experience-driven – from
                cabs to entertainment to automobile and more. A timely tip or an
                extra help or a unique service can put a smile and leave a
                lasting impression on you.
              </p>

              />
              <p>
                It’s no different in buildings where you need to have the best
                facility experience to wow your tenants and to stay ahead of
                real estate competition. Moreover 80% of the building life cycle
                cost is spent on operations, repair, and recapitalisation, which
                means you spend 5 to 6.5 times more money on operational costs
                than on construction costs. To put things into context there are
                a lot of inefficiencies at the core of buildings and hence
                potential to better optimise operations + elevate experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet the current traditional approach to facilities management
                has placed you at a blind spot with limited supply of critical
                real-time information. Day in and day out, you continue to
                fire-fight issues rather than being in control of things.
              </p>
              <p>
                With real-time data from BAS connected to your everyday facility
                workflows, you can immediately pinpoint inefficiencies, solve
                problems faster and proactively
                <span
                  id="how-can-real-time-fo-help-improve-tenant-experience"
                ></span>
                (rather than reactively) manage your facilities. End of day you
                can provide experience with an edge and put that smile on your
                customers.

                cold or too hot. What are the odds that you, as a tenant, stay
