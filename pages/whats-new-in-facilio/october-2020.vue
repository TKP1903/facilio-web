                    <p>Wondering how to track the energy consumption for a particular area - space, floor, building, or site? Virtual meter allows you to combine energy readings from multiple physical meters for an accurate calculation of total utilization for any part of your portfolio. </p>

                      Not only from BAS or other building systems, now you can perform energy metering based on any building variable like running time in hours, power(kVA), and so on, to meet your exact need.

                    <p>Using average values of metrics like response time, etc. to calculate SLA is common - but may fail to capture crucial instances of poor service. By attaching SLA to every service ticket, the grey areas of your service delivery present themselves quite clearly. </p>

                      Changing an electrical switch or compressor is not nearly as time-consuming as performing refurbishment works. But similar SLA timelines for widely different tasks may lead to inaccurate reports. Ace your SLAs with the flexibility to define timelines based on maintenance categories.
