                      Be on top of critical changes happening every day within
                      your building. Now, when a change is made to a priority
                      field or work order, the right authority will be notified
                      and the process won’t be acted upon until approval is
                      received. Track approvals and processes to get a complete
                      picture of everything happening in your building in one
                      tab.

                      Within the approval order, drill down on the approving
                      authority based on role, user, tenant, team, field,
                      vendor, etc. Reach the right authority for every situation
                      with completely customizable fields for every category of
                      operations—electrical, fire safety, energy, etc. While
                      setting up the approval, decide on the mode of
                      notifications and request for mandatory comments for
                      rejecting an approval order to ensure maximum
                      transparency.

                      More often than not, assets run for longer than they need
                      to and at less optimal levels. Time charts show you a
                      report of the absolute time that an asset has been running
                      for. Now, with data-backed reports at hand, you can
                      understand which pieces of equipment are underutilized or
                      overworked and invest accordingly.
